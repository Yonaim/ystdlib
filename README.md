# Overview

This project is a personal reimplementation of C++ Standard Library.
The name 'ystdlib' is an acronym for 'yona-standard-library', just to avoid conflicts with the original one.

(After completing this project, I also plan to reimplement parts of the Boost Graph Library (BGL), especially its graph data structures.)
